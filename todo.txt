Log calculations for climb
Replace 'N/A' with '-' in A/C picker
Finetune heights of empty spaces in results tab
Hide irrelevant corrections (if = 0) in takeoff and landing calculations on results tab
Check outputs on results tab for reasonable rounding (headwind/tailwind is not rounded, but check others as well)
The interpolation weights and temperatures for climb calculations should draw from their own variables, and not the ones from landing
