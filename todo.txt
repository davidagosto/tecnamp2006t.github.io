- Log calculations for climb
- Replace 'N/A' with '-' in A/C picker
- Finetune heights of empty spaces in results tab
- Check outputs on results tab for reasonable rounding (headwind/tailwind is not rounded, but check others as well)
- The interpolation weights and temperatures for climb calculations should draw from their own variables, and not the ones from landing
- Add logic to change 'headwind' to 'tailwind' as appropriate, and also change the formula to be correct
- Don't round wind components, should always use whole knots. -not even 1 decimal?
- Add warning to end users when input data is out of AFM parameters
- Double check that roc pressure altitude is not double corrected for pressure
