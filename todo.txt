Log calculations for climb
Output wind components to end user
Replace 'N/A' with '-' in A/C picker
Finetune heights of empty spaces in results tab
Landing corrections needs fix - they are currently just a copy of Takeoff corrections
Hide irrelevant corrections (if = 0) in takeoff and landing calculations on results tab
Check outputs on results tab for reasonable rounding (headwind/tailwind is not rounded, but check others as well)
The interpolation weights and temperatures for climb calculations should draw from their own variables, and not the ones from landing
Percentage signs doesn't show on gradient equations, I cant figure out how to typeset them correctly
